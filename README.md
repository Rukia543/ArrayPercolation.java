# ArrayPercolation.java
This project simulates percolation in an N x N grid using arrays. It models the flow of fluid through porous materials, a concept often used in physics and computational modeling. The goal is to determine whether a system percolates â€” meaning fluid can travel from the top to the bottom through open sites.
